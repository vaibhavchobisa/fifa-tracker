FIFA World Cup tracking app, with Fixture and Leaderboard tracking.

A web app to keep a track of FIFA World Cup. It has routes to 3 pages: 'Schedule' (past & upcoming fixtures), 'Leaderboard' which contains logic to tackle rankings when different teams have equal score, and 'Error404' route which would be mounted for any route other than the first 2.
